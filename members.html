							 Once upon a time in the 1990s, my mother and my father met one another and started to
							 become good friends. Later on, they developed a delightful and intimate relationship 
							 with one another. The parents did not only exchange their love, but they have used their inquisitive
							 intelligence and their compassion to get through daily life. Soon enough, they had the
							 courage, determination and hard-working attitudes to settle down. I, Marissa came into the world in 1999, while
							 my brother Daniel was born in the year, 2007. Until today, we are united as one and enjoying the pleasures of
							 what a real family is truly like. To learn more about each of us, browse our descriptions on the left side of the page.
