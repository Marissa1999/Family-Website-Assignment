						         <h3> The Tough and Determined One </h3>
						 
						 </hgroup>
						
						
						
						 <p>
						 
						    My father is a very strong and intelligent man. As a child, he was always determined to
							perform his best in everything he does. He would always study, exercise and do something
							to improve his health. Again, just like the other close members of my family, he is considered
							as a very special dad. He is not the typical dad, who would go to the bar and stay with his
							friends. He is known for being loyal with my mother and does his best to protect us from harm.
							As my father grew up, he was a smart individual and very sensitive while people judge him. He
							always needed to improve himself and do more than the crowd. As a tough man, he flourished in his
                            studies and managed to beat other competitors when it comes to advanced physics, mathematics and
                            physical education. He has always been strong and brave, with no room of having a vast social life. 
							According to his current interests, he enjoys hearing the news all day, constantly educating himself
                            through academic articles, camping and watching sports such as hockey and especially soccer. 
							If you would meet him in person, he might come off as very defensive and not the friendliest person 
							like my brother or mother. However with some respect, he will calm down and express himself
                            similar to a gentleman.
