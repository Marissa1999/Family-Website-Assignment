							 If I would have to describe myself in three words, it would be mysterious, brilliant
							 and silent. That's right. Comparing to other 18 year-olds, I am considered as an old
							 soul in a positive light. My personality can be very giving and heartwarming,
							 only to those who take the time to get to know me and treat me well. I am not the most
							 sociable person, but I feel that I stand out from the young crowd. In my opinion, I don't 
							 value materialism and the obsession of cellular devices. Just like my father, I am ambitious 
							 and strive for the best of success in my life. In the past, I have accomplished educational studies
							 and always remain competitive among my peers. I managed to receive recognition for my
							 good grades from high school until my first semester of college. Besides academics, I enjoy
							 to learn about the detailed art and ancient history. I enjoy various genres of music such as 
							 blues, jazz and classical. However, what I love most is classic rock. Since my high school years 
							 and similar to my mother, music has helped me overcome the toughest of situations and has allowed 
							 me to reflex upon daily life. Personally, I enjoy the band U2, but I have decided to expand my 
							 taste with the band, The Who. Every time I listen their music, I become more motivated, reflective,
                             and tough when bad situations arise.
