				             What can I say about my brother? He is one of the best closest siblings I ever
							 have in my entire family. Presently as a 10 year-old, he is different than most boys.
							 He is a brother who really cares about others' emotions and enjoys learning about science
							 and magic illusions. He also has a very charismatic character and always tries to be the 
							 audience's entertainer. Daniel always wants to try to make friends with anyone that he meets.
							 He still remains confident, even if he goes through the process of rejection. He doesn't care
							 and continues to move on with life. To name a few amazing hobbies, my brother loves to create
							 many artistic projects such as origami, cartoons and clay models. He is also a talented and
							 fantastic drummer that he could do the bossa nova as a beginner student. In my opinion, I find
							 that talent truly amazing... I hope that he continues on his skills, so he can earn some recognition
							 one day. If you would get the chance to meet him, he is very laid back and he will always include
							 you in conversation without judging others. As my brother, he is humble, kind and a smart boy. If you
							 are nice towards him, he will take the time to entertain you all day without feeling bored. I am
							 grateful that I have a good brother, whom I can depend on as an adult raising my own family.
