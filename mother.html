							 When you feel left out, alone and isolated from the world, my mother has the
							 capabilities to heal those deep emotional wounds. As a person, my mom grew up
							 to be a very compassionate and thoughtful person in her heart. Working as a blood
							 drawer in St. Mary's Hospital, my mother meets people everyday with all kinds of
							 personalities. Since she got this job, she developed her social and technical skills
							 required to succeed, even with a large number of patients. If you do get the chance to
							 meet her, she will be very shy at first. However with time, she will be in her comfortable
							 zone, making many hilarious jokes. She is the type of mom who is not obsessed with the pressures
							 of other competitive mothers. She is very simple, approachable and patient with anyone who
							 is nice and respectful towards her. Along with her fantastic personality, she loves listening
							 to music in her free time. Preferably, she adores the band U2. Ever since as a teenager, she decided
                             to take a chance and listen to their music. A few albums later, she gained a deep appreciation for
                             the band due to the positive messages and great melodies. Other catchy 80s music in general lights up her 
							 world and get through the pressures of rough society. Music made her how she is today: confident and independent.
